# Giftastic

###What the project does:

In its simplest form, this project is a gif generator that contain HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery elements. There are default topic buttons that have been included in the loading screen, but the user also can create their own topic buttons by typing it in the input box, and clicking submit.

In order to obtain the ratings and gifs from Giphy, an ajax request to Giphy's API was needed. The JSON data was then stored as global variables so they could be accessed a later time.

If the user wants to display the gifs and ratings from Giphy, a topic button needs to be clicked. After it has been clicked, the rating and a still image of the gif will appear. If the user wants to animate the image, they need to click the gif.

Once the user is finished enjoying the gifs, they can clear the contents on the page by clicking the button "clear content". 

###Why the project is useful:

This project is useful in demonestrating the importance of an ajax request, and how that data is stored and utilized.


###How users can get started with the project:

Users can start the project by either clicking an existing topic button to generate gif's or they can create their own topic button and click that one instead to display their desired gif content.
